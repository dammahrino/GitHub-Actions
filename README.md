## What are GitHub Actions?
It's a workflow automation service, provided by GitHub, that automates all kinds of repository-related processes and actions.

Continuous Integration (CI)
: Code changes are automatically build, tested and merged with existing code.

Continuous Delivery (CD)
: After integration, new app or package versions are published automatically.
